# Fireworks & Balloon Spectacle

An interactive animation project that combines stunning fireworks and balloon effects with dynamic text rendering. This visually engaging project uses HTML5 Canvas to create fireworks explosions, balloons floating along paths, and text that appears to be drawn by these effects.

## Features

- **Fireworks Display**: Simulates realistic firework explosions with colorful sparks.
- **Balloon Animation**: Balloons float along customizable paths, adding a playful touch to the animation.
- **Dynamic Text Rendering**: Text is animated to appear as if it is being drawn by these effects.
- **Interactive Visuals**: The fireworks and balloons interact with the canvas and create an immersive visual experience.
- **Customization Options**: Easily adjust the speed, color, size, and more for fireworks and balloon animations.

## Components

- **Canvas Element**: The primary rendering surface for all animations.
- **Fireworks**: Randomly generated fireworks explode across the canvas with customizable particles.
- **Balloon Paths**: Balloons follow animated paths and interact with the environment.
- **Text Rendering**: The specified text is drawn letter by letter, synchronized with the fireworks and balloons.
- **Particle Effects**: Use of particles to simulate fireworks and other animated effects.

## How It Works

1. **Fireworks Creation**: Fireworks particles are spawned from a random location and follow a set trajectory, creating an explosion effect.
2. **Balloon Animation**: Balloons are spawned and float along animated paths, adding motion to the scene.
3. **Text Animation**: The text is split into characters, each of which is animated individually to create the illusion of being drawn by fireworks and balloons.
4. **Interactive Animation**: The fireworks and balloons continuously animate, creating a lively and ever-changing visual environment.
