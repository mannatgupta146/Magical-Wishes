# Magical Wishes

Magical Wishes is a delightful web application that lets users create, send, and share magical birthday wishes. With its charming interface and customizable features, it adds a touch of joy and warmth to every celebration. Perfect for spreading positivity and love, Magical Wishes makes birthdays even more special!

## How It Works

1. **Fireworks Creation**: Fireworks particles are spawned from a random location and follow a set trajectory, creating an explosion effect.
2. **Balloon Animation**: Balloons are spawned and float along animated paths, adding motion to the scene.
3. **Text Animation**: The text is split into characters, each of which is animated individually to create the illusion of being drawn by fireworks and balloons.
4. **Interactive Animation**: The fireworks and balloons continuously animate, creating a lively and ever-changing visual environment.
